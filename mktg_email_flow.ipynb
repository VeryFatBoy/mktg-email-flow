For example, what if a user had registered for our service but had not yet completed the installation of the analytics tracking code on their website?\n\nWe have a MongoDB database populated with some user data that looks like this:\n\n```\n{\n    '_id': ObjectId('64afb3fda9295d8421e7a19f'),\n    'first_name': 'James',\n    'last_name': 'Villanueva',\n    'company_name': 'Foley-Turner',\n    'stage': 'generating a tracking code',\n    'created_date': 1987-11-09T12:43:26.000+00:00\n}\n```\n\nTake particular note of the key `stage`, we will be using that to help identify user behaviour and have ChatGPT enhance our emails.\n\nBelow we use MongoDB as a source for user behaviour, then use that to have ChatGPT write some more useful emails for the users.\n\n### Setup MongoDB Atlas\n\nWe’ll use MongoDB Atlas in an M0 Sandbox. We'll configure an **admin** user with **atlasAdmin** privileges under **Database Access**. We’ll temporarily allow access from anywhere (IP Address 0.0.0.0/0) under **Network Access**. We’ll note down the `password` and `host`.\n\n### Load the data into MongoDB Atlas\n\nNext, we'll load the sample data into MongoDB Atlas. We’ll create a new database called `mktg_email_demo` with a collection called `customers`. We’ll load data into this collection. The data load can be accomplished in several ways, such as using MongoDB Compass or mongoimport. The dataset can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/VeryFatBoy/mktg-email-flow).\n\n### Connect to MongoDB Atlas\n\nBelow, we'll connect to MongoDB Atlas.
